run-drainfill-v00
  3 day fill-drain cycle. Doesn't drain as low as needed.
run-drainfill-v01
  4 day cycle. And zero out horizontal viscosity and diffusion.
  It does continue to drain some, but still only gets
  down to 0.67m, where it should be 0.55m or lower.

run_tide_test-v01
  Tide timing, overall datum good.
  Drains too fast.

run_tide_test-v02
  Try higher friction (still global), from 0.023 to 0.03.
  High water basically unchanged.  Low water had same shape, but shifted
  upwards.

run_tide_test-v03
  Revert friction, add mouth structure with gate opening width. Also
  shorten time frame. Draining too slow. CrestWidth was 0.3, might have
  been a problem.  Run again with no CrestWidth set.

run_tide_test-v04
  CrestWidth removed. GateOpeningWidth still 5m. Closer, but bottoms
  out too high.

run_tide_test-v05
  Width to 10m, and drop crestLevel/gate lower edge to 0.2 (may not make a
  a difference with the bathy). Basically looked like v01.

run_tide_tide-v06
  Bring the width back down to 5.0
  
run_filldrain-v04
  No additional changes.  Running on cws linuxmodeling, and make naming
  consistent
  
run_flow_test-v01
  Likewise. N add'l changes, just naming and running on cws-linuxmodeling.

run_flow_test-v02
  No mouth structure in place.

run_salt_20160520-v00
  Run with salinity BCs, but still 2D.

run_tide_test-v07
  Manually testing out variable structure
  
run_salt_20160520-v01
  Bring in ESA QCM for mouth geometry.  Rerunning this with fixed paths in structures.ini
  
run_salt_20160520-v02
  Revert to 2D to diagnose nan values in v01.  Works ok in 2D.
  
run_salt_20160520-v03
  Try 3D, now z layers.

run_salt_20160520-v04
  Debugging hole in delta marsh. Should be fixed, with extra call to edge_to_cells
  
run_salt_20160520-v05
  Running with updated QCM output.
  This was twitchy, very slow. Also some bad z-layer distribution due to overly deep
  flow BCs.
  
run_salt_20160520-v06
  Try similar but in 2D, diagnosing twitchiness. Went crazy unstable in Butano Marsh.

run_salt_20160520-v07
  Turn off density effects via Idensform=0, everything else the same. That runs okay,
  time steps around 10s, salinity spikes to 45psu.

run_salt_20160520-v08
  Upgrade to 2021.03, and turn density effects back on. Not quite as wild, but it
  gets crazy salinity and eventually bad velocity, too.

run_salt_20160520-v09
  Shorten run, increase map output, and change layer type to 1 (sigma), to see if it
  changes anything even in 2D.  Salt goes nan by hour 2. (temp, too)

run_salt_20160520-v10
  as in v09, but also setLimtypsa=0. Salt goes nan by hour 2 (temp, too)

run_salt_20160520-v11
  back to z-layers. and setLimtypsa=0. Temp has spikes as early as 1h in.

run_salt_20160520-v12
  12 hour run with 5 minute output.  Gets twitchy velocities, and some wacky temperatures
  but not quite as crazy as before.

run_salt_20160520-v13
  Near the end of the run still get nonphysical increase in concentration both in
  temp and salt. This run had conservative 0.45 CFL max, minmod limiter, and 1mm
  drying threshold.
  
run_salt_20160520-v14
  Any difference from setting Kmx=0 instead of 1? Yes, but still get nonconservative
  behavior.

run_salt_20160520-v15
  What about using 1.6.1? No different, or if you squint, a tiny bit worse

run_salt_20160520-v16
  Shift everything to the origin: no difference.

run_salt_20160520-v17
  Remove all scalar variation. Temp=18 everywhere, salt=0 everywhere. No accumulation
  in either one.

run_salt_20160520-v18
  Increase EpsHU from 0.001 to 0.005 => no improvement.

run_salt_20160520-v19
  Limtypsa to 2, and LayerType to 0. No change.

run_salt_20160520-v20
  TransportTimestepping from 0 to 1. No change.
  
run_salt_20160520-v21
  TransportMethod from 1 to 2. Disables transport entirely.

run_salt_20160520-v22
  TransportMethod from 1 to 0: Seg fault

run_salt_20160520-v23
  Turn off flow node renumbering, and switch bedlevtype 4->3

run_salt_20160520-v24
  Just switching bedlevtype. Verifying change in results is from bedlevtype.
  Verified.

run_salt_20160520-v25
  What about bedlevtype 5. Even better, though still some (60kg) excess salt.

run_salt_20160520-v26
  Keep bedlevtype 5, and set to 3D with single layer. Error gets worse (450kg)
  
run_salt_20160520-v27
  bedlevtype 6, keep Kmx=1

run_salt_20160520-v28: test back to small epshu. no change.

run_salt_20160520-v29: test Dcenterinside (no change)

run_salt_20160520-v30: tried reverting most of those changes, but results were
   worse. Likely due to reverting CFLmax (yes), maybe limtypsa (no).

run_salt_20160520-v31: back to CFLmax=0.45, and I get the 60kg excess salt mass back

run_salt_20160520-v32: CFLmax=0.25? actually worse than CFLmax=0.45

run_salt_20160520-v33: back to CFLmax=0.45, and now go full 3D.
  -- fixed precision bug in layering
  -- failing out with short timesteps
  -- with 14 layers, but no constraint on zbot/ztop/stretch, it runs okay but slow.

run_salt_20160520-v34:
  Test UGRID output. Not useful it seems.
  
run_salt_20160520-v35: trying to find additional output options, but no luck (I think)

run_salt_20160520-v36: test ztop and zbot close to their original values. runs okay.

run_salt_20160520-v37: test ztop higher.  Fails with slow dt.

run_salt_20160520-v38: turn on stairstepping. No improvement.

run_salt_20160520-v39: ?
run_salt_20160520-v40: ?

run_salt_20160520-v41: test bedlevtype=5

run_salt_20160520-v42:
 bedlevtype=5, and quantize bathy near interfaces

run_salt_20160520-v43:
 Attempt to simplify mouth structure, but still get bad dt at boundary
 
run_salt_20160520-v44:
 New grid!  v01.  Still fails out with timestep issues.
 
run_salt_20160520-v45: Shot in the dark, remove the mouth structure entirely.

run_salt_20160520-v46: Attempt to get more details in *.steps files on timestep issues.
 -- got steps output, still trying to understand it.
 
run_salt_20160520-v47: Same, but run serial in case this is an MPI issue.

run_salt_20160520-v48: Try numtopsig=3

run_salt_20160520-v49:
  AutoTimestep=3, from 5, and AutoTimestepNoStruct=1 from 0
  Seems to have run okay.  Avg. timestep 0.49s, still short, but it finishes.

run_salt_20160520-v50:
  Back to MPI, make sure it runs okay.  Runs the same as serial.

run_salt_20160520-v51:
  Test AutoTimestep=4. Slower, no clear advantage.
  
run_salt_20160520-v52:
  Revert some of the debugging settins, and re-include the mouth.

run_salt_20160520-v53: PCH culverts: preserve area, but make it wide and short
  to distribute the flow across cells.  This allowed the average timestep to
  go from 0.79 s (v52) to 1.36 s (v53).

run_salt_20160520-v54:
  Go for 12 m wide, which makes the height 0.0167m
  Rerun with ugrid output.  

run_salt_20160520-v55:
  Longer run (2months).  Ran fine, though salinity is not looking great.

[56: failed to actually make the change]

run_salt_20160520-v57:
  Double vertical resolution to see how that affects things.
  Went nan after 3 days.
  
run_salt_20160520-v58:
  Keep extra vertical res, try the slower autotimestep option 4.  Running, though
  slow. Accidentally overwritten by run with closure turned off.
  This seems to have lost its BCs.
  
run_salt_20160520-v59:
  Revert stompy changes that were meant to drop obsolete settings from mdu.
  That gets the BCs.
  
run_salt_20160520-v60:
  Keep the obsolete stuff, but try again with turning off Turb.

run_salt_20160520-v61:
  Bump up turbulence to 5e-4, turn off turb advection => not stable (?)

run_salt_20160520-v62:
  vicww up to 5e-3, now stable, if slow. Might be helping with stratification, but hard to
  tell.
  
run_salt_20160520-v63:
  Adopt Sophie's changes to the mouth structures, adjust start date a bit later. This goes
  for 7 days or so then crashes. Salt doesn't really look any better, mouth flux is anemic,
  maybe 35% what it should be, while tidal range is pretty close, maybe 85% what it should
  be. Seeming like a big lack of storage.

run_salt_20160520-v65:
  Switch to Sophie's time period, bump up friction, and change salt IC to 32.0.
  This led to no freshwater coming down.

run_salt_20160520-v66:
  Explicitly set salinity BC on creeks. Also with the 2.0 m2 culverts.

run_salt_20160520-v67:
  Bump culverts to 4 m2, to see if there is any effect. Hardly any effect.  Like 0.01 ppt?

run_salt_20160520-v68:
  Try keepzlayeringatbed. Slightly slower, and fresher, but no change in strat.

run_salt_20160520-v69:
  Vertadvtypsal=5. Not expecting anything different...

run_salt_20160520-v70:
  Vertadvtypsal=0. No vertical advection?  Seems unlikely to be good.
  This is ever so slightly fresher than v66, and appears identical to v69, which is
  a bit surprising as v69 should have been identical to 66.

run_salt_20160520-v71 on farm:
  slow, but it was split across nodes
  
run_salt_20160520-v71b on farm:
  trying on a single node

run_salt_20160520-v71:
  Back to v66 settings, but enable checkerboard stuff. Errors out, options not supported

run_salt_20160520-v72: Try sigma! Fresher, but not better.

run_salt_20160520-v73: Try hex grid in lagoon. Very similar to v66.

run_salt_20160520-v74: Sigma, with checkerboard options enabled.

run_salt_20160520-v75: Sigma, include hor momentum filter=1.  Super slow.


run_salt_20160520-v76: Sigma, include hor momentum filter=2, openmp... Also super slow.

run_salt_20160520-v77: back to "stock" ish settings, but frequent map output
 - might have corrupted this, when failing to change name of next run

run_salt_20160520-v78: from 77, transportmethod=0,l dicoww=0.0 : these fail to run.

run_salt_20160520-v78:
  Just trying a really low friction, 0.01. ran out of disk space. rerunning.
  
run_salt_20160520-v79:
  revert friction, try superbee limiter and no forester. forester was already disabled.
  This looks identical to 66. So basically I can't make any changes to the limiter.
  
run_salt_20160520-v80:
  Deepen the lagoon by the UCB grid. Not a big change, but maybe see something?

run_salt_20160520-v81:
  Spatially variable friction.  Average timestep 1.18s,

run_salt_20160520-v82:
  Test sensitivity to kmx, back to 14 layers.
 
run_salt_20160520-v83:
  Compress the vertical range.

run_salt_20160520-v84:
  Try again turning off closure, test 0 salt diffusivity, 1e-3 viscosity
  Glorious stratification

run_salt_20160520-v85:
  Same but longer. Salt went nan after 10 days.

run_salt_20160520-v86:
  Farm run, with Dicoww=0 and turb model=3. Also goes nan, like v85.

run_salt_20160520-v87:
  Like v85, but include 1e-10 dicoww, and drop vicoww to 2e-4.
  cws-linuxmodeling. Stuck around 1.5h, probably salt went nan.

run_salt_20160520-v88:
  Like v85, but include 1e-10 dicoww, and drop vicoww to 2e-4.
  Farm. First go at this failed quickly. Bump Vicoww back to 1e-3,
  try again in the same directory

run_salt_20160520-v89:
  Like v86, but VertAdvTypSal=4, and forester=50. Crashed after 18h.
  Timestep went to 0. Try again but with forester=20. Pretty slow, at 0.4s,
  and model bottom salinity is non-physical, saltier 

[Fixed(?) qcm width nans]

run_salt_20160520-v90:
  Turb=3, dicoww=1e-7, vertadv=6.
  Wedged at 7d. This is with the more conservative time stepping, already.
  
run_salt_20160520-v91:
  Turb=3, dicoww=1e-8, vertadv=6.
  Also wedged, same dt->0 then 300.0, but this one at 15h.

run_salt_20160520-v92:
  Turb=3, dicoww=1e-7, vertadv=6, and no layer compression.
  Still going, very slow though. Timestep currently at 1s, but
  it's running at <3x realtime. It's scheduled okay. It's on a
  somewhat busy node. Checking back later, it's averaging 13x
  realtime. dt still low, 0.8s or so.  And it's only 9 days in.
  Around 16days it went nan. killed.

run_salt_20160520-v93:
  Turb=3, dicoww=1e-6, vertadv=6, and no layer compression.
  Checked on it and it's 14 days in, dt=0.57s, low, but maybe ok?
  Clocking in at 26x realtime.
  dt getting even lower, but it's running.
  47% done, dt something like 3s? But it's gone off the rails.
  Went nan around 7/4.
  
run_salt_20160520-v94: identical to 92, trying to understand if the
  issue is the node or the code. This went to dt=0 at 9d13:30. A little
  beyond 92. killed.

run_salt_20160520-v95: bump up to 32 cores, and CFLmax=0.4, otherwise
  repeat of 92, dicoww=1e-7. Still going. dt=0.6, which considering the CFLmax
  is not too bad. But it's only 3 days into the run. Trouble likely lies ahead.
  23% done. Stuck at 38%, dt->0, 24.5 days
  
run_salt_20160520-v93-restart
  A restart from a nice tidal portion of v93 for an animation.  Seems very slow
  to get going. Second go round, fails at 2.5days

run_salt_20160520-v96
  Like 93, but use grid with deep-bias bathymetry.
  
run_salt_20160520-v97
  Try 96 again, but with more map output and more conservative timestep (CFLmax=0.4, from 0.7)
  
run_salt_20160520-v98
  Again again, but on cws-linuxmodeling. Crashes. Looks like crazy water levels start around
  the ocean boundary.

run_salt_20160520-v99
  Again^3, but lower ZBot to -1.7m

run_salt_20160520-v100
  Back to farm, keep that ZBot. Decrease N Marsh friction to 0.015. Back to longer run
  with sparse map output.
  
run_salt_20160520-v101
  Decrease dicoww and vicoww. Long run -- 42 days.

run_salt_20160520-v102 (cws)
  Testing layers in old config
  
run_salt_20160520-v103 (cws)
  Testing layers in new config. Bottom layer extra thick, all others
  concentrated around lagoon depth.

run_salt_20160520-v104 (farm)
  Like 103, but long run on farm.
  
run_salt_20160520-v105 (farm)
  Decrease friction in inlet, longer transect output. Try default
  timestepping setting, and use default initial waterlevel.
  
run_salt_20160520-v106 (farm)
  Decrease 'extra_resistance' for the mouth structures from 4 to 1.
  
run_salt_20160520-v107 (farm)
  Revert the 'extra_resistance', and dial down eddy visco/diffusivity
  by another 10.  Shorter run.

run_salt_20160520-v108 (farm)
  Add that forester business back in. With no real improvement.

run_salt_20160520-v109 (farm)
  Bump up layers to 50, and some more vertical compression.
  That got more strat
  
run_salt_20160520-v110 (farm)
  Remembered that the reservoir example that Ed mentioned (that Herman
  favors?) used a centered scheme (2 or 4?) and the forester.  Will try
  that again, same vertical setup as v109.
  
run_salt_20160520-v111 (farm)
  Drop the centered scheme, and bump layers up to 100. Actually seems
  that I did *not* change the scheme, just changed the number of layers.
  
run_salt_20160520-v112 (farm)
  Try that again but changing the scheme.

run_salt_20160520-v113 (farm)
  Same structures, but bring in the change to {up,down}{1,2}streamlevel,
  set them all to 0.25, from 1.0.

run_salt_20160520-v114 (farm)
  Drop one structure, include frictional pillars.

run_salt_20160520-v115 (farm)
  Synthetic bed with salinity

run_salt_20160520-v116 (farm)
  Two structure, increased friction. Thought I dropped a structure but
  apparently not. Results were good, though.

run_salt_20160520-v117 (farm)
  100 structures. 2D was promising...
