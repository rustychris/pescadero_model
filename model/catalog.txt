run-drainfill-v00
  3 day fill-drain cycle. Doesn't drain as low as needed.
run-drainfill-v01
  4 day cycle. And zero out horizontal viscosity and diffusion.
  It does continue to drain some, but still only gets
  down to 0.67m, where it should be 0.55m or lower.

run_tide_test-v01
  Tide timing, overall datum good.
  Drains too fast.

run_tide_test-v02
  Try higher friction (still global), from 0.023 to 0.03.
  High water basically unchanged.  Low water had same shape, but shifted
  upwards.

run_tide_test-v03
  Revert friction, add mouth structure with gate opening width. Also
  shorten time frame. Draining too slow. CrestWidth was 0.3, might have
  been a problem.  Run again with no CrestWidth set.

run_tide_test-v04
  CrestWidth removed. GateOpeningWidth still 5m. Closer, but bottoms
  out too high.

run_tide_test-v05
  Width to 10m, and drop crestLevel/gate lower edge to 0.2 (may not make a
  a difference with the bathy). Basically looked like v01.

run_tide_tide-v06
  Bring the width back down to 5.0
  
run_filldrain-v04
  No additional changes.  Running on cws linuxmodeling, and make naming
  consistent
  
run_flow_test-v01
  Likewise. N add'l changes, just naming and running on cws-linuxmodeling.

run_flow_test-v02
  No mouth structure in place.

run_salt_20160520-v00
  Run with salinity BCs, but still 2D.

run_tide_test-v07
  Manually testing out variable structure
  
run_salt_20160520-v01
  Bring in ESA QCM for mouth geometry.  Rerunning this with fixed paths in structures.ini
  
run_salt_20160520-v02
  Revert to 2D to diagnose nan values in v01.  Works ok in 2D.
  
run_salt_20160520-v03
  Try 3D, now z layers.

run_salt_20160520-v04
  Debugging hole in delta marsh. Should be fixed, with extra call to edge_to_cells
