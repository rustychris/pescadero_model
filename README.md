This repository contains the Delft Flexible Mesh (DFM) model setup for
Pescadero Lagoon.

Getting Started
--

The model setup is scripted in python, and draws heavily from
the stompy library: https://github.com/rustychris/stompy

Before running the model, you'll need to customize relevant
paths.  Copy model/local_config.py.in to model/local_config.py and
edit paths/settings as necessary.
