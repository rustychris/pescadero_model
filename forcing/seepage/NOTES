Can BMI be used alongside MPI? How does it work?
 - yes, and it does work.
 - see mpi_with_bmi.py in dfm_tests.
 - potentially could duplicate MPI communicator and have proper
   communication in the script, but compilation becomes tricky since
   it ties the python libraries to the DFM libaries.
 - works well enough to read history output on rank 0, and write TIM
   forcing "just-in-time"
